The thing that makes people join is being employed in early game buildings

Working in modern ways gives the access to factions that are actually pro-galactic space fairing

They will go kicking and screaming into modernity


i feel like stellaris doesnt have a grounding for why pops beleive the ethics that they do. in vicky pops further their personal interest in government but in stellaris an administrator that has the potential to be an authoritarian despot just decides not to because they prefer egalitarian flavored icecream. there is a bit of "being at war makes you like it", but generally pops fall in line with what the government says.

i would _imagine_ that the primary political concern of stellaris governments in thsi time period would be outgrowing outmoded pre-ftl, one-planet style governance. things like keeping time despite not sharing a star become difficult, currencies that can be accepted everywhere, post abundance thinking. in early agricultural societies the state was a terrible thing to be a part of, and most people melted away to the peripherary when they got the chance. the tight control from the center was inefficient and coarse. perhaps early colonization is similar? maybe it is not until the mid game that you really form "real" governments and control over colonies.
