Factions have usefulness towards modernizing your state. Each ethic will only be good at certain modernization efforts.

Factions should not align with ethics, but with a response to the following phases:
    Early expansion and exploration
    First clashes
    Federation forming
    Midgame crisis
    Galactic Community
    War in Heaven
    Crisis

Factions should prefer one policy option. 

How can we map the policy <-> faction programmatically?
