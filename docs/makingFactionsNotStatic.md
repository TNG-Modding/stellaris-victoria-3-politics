Factions have usefulness towards modernizing your state. Each ethic will only be good at certain modernization efforts.

Factions should not align with ethics, but with a response to the following phases:
    Early expansion and exploration
        Peaceful Expansion
            Armed Isolationism
            Colonists
        Military Expansion
            Our Burden
            Death and Destruction
            Realpolitik
        Consolidation
    
    Federation forming
    Midgame crisis
        Khanate
            Adoption
            Resistance
            Isolationist
    Galactic Community
        War at Expense
        Join
        Rule
    War in Heaven
        Contender Faction
    Crisis

Factions should prefer one policy option. 

How can we map the policy <-> faction programmatically?
