Would you be a conservative in Stellaris?
You see the landowners in Victoria 3 being reactionary to republican liberals. now in american politics you see conversatives defending the defining principles of what was then liberal thought.

Id imagine after discovering the hyperlanes, there would be those who defend the inherit beauty or whatever of the views espoused by pre-ftl earth. No way would society remain the same spreading across the galaxy, there are going to be earth-like reactionary beliefs. id imagine even pre-unification beliefs of self determination and particularism would still be kicking around.

Would pre-ftl beliefs and conservativism be unique to each empire? Like is conservatism a truly held belief or just a not-so-fast reaction? If the latter then each empire would have its own unique flavor of being a wet blanket.

id imagine surmounting pre-unification particularism and resistance to the necessary centralizing efforts of maintaining galactic empire would be the biggest early challenges for an early empire. or at least, the each empire would have "pre-ftl reactionaries" that are the mirror of your governing ethics to model that particularism, rather always being an egalitarian particularism

Your government should not be ready to face the challenges of galactic governance. This would set you apart from fallen empires that have the right governement institutions but no umf to them.

How can we make starting empires feel like autocratic, slaving, plantation economies among industrialized nations
